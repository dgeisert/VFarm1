# Virtual Farm 1

This originally was based on https://github.com/dgeisert/VRFarm

I broke this off when I wanted to slim down the project, if you look at the previous one I had downloaded many many assets from the asset store.

This is built for the Gear VR, and has an interaction system to allow for play within the Unity editor.  Use the mouse to equate to gaze and use A and D for turning.

You can add your compatible android device to the project by going to this link and logging in on your device:

[OSig Generator](https://dashboard.oculus.com/tools/osig-generator/)

Then add the osig file to Assets/Plugins/Android/assets/ directory

The main thing to do is chop trees, but there is a loading/saving/spawning system that I was testing as well.  To use that N makes more trees, M destroys all trees, K saves the current state, L loads the saved state.
